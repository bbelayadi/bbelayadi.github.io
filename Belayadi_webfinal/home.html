               My name is Bouthaina Belayadi and I am studying to became an Architect. I took this class to help me expand my knowledge on Adobe to hopefully use it for my future design projects. The typeface I used for this project is Helvetica Neue Bold and Avenir Next Condensed Ultra Light. I chose to cover all the cards with a light peachy cover with a dark purple lining and personally drawn pedals as the design.
